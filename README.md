1. Theme: Project on Disaster management

2. Project Description: An Interactive Voice Response interface (IVR), designed to deal in emegergency situations at the time of calamities. 
It helps the victims stuck in the disaster to connect the rescue centres, with the help of this voice-bot, rescue centres can reach to the urgent
victims at the earliest by prioritising their real time status/condition. The user has the option to enter the following:
 		1. Critically stuck
		2. Medical emergency
		3. Food shortage
This is done with the help of  Twilio service and based upon Flask Web Framework
The twilio provides the required IVR for the voice-bot. Based on the choices made by caller, it creates a dataset in the twilio for above three different 
scenarios. This dataset is sent to rescue centres which can be further processed to take appropriate actions. Thus, helping victims and the team to cope with 
the situation.

4. Future Scope: This project if further more developed with tie up with government agencies can prove to be a significant step in such rescue operations .
Our proposal to enhance this project includes : 1.Adding the location tracking feature of the caller. 
				           2. Speech recognition to answer the general queries of the victim.
